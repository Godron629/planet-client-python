Examples
========

Get the latest 10 items from the API of any ItemType::

    planet data search --limit 10

Get recently acquired PSScene3Band ItemType records::

    planet data search --item-type PSScene3Band --date gt 2017-02-14

Item types can be specified case-insensitively, with prefix matching in the CLI::

    planet data search --item-type psscene --date gt 2017-02-14

Search for a month. Note: criteria are applied as an AND filter::

    planet data search --item-type PSScene3Band --date acquired gt 2017-02-14 --date acquired lt 2017-03-14

Use the geometry defined in `aoi.json` to constrain a search for both PSScene3Band and PSScene4Band::

    planet data search --item-type PSScene3Band --item-type PSScene4Band --geom aoi.json

Output a search filter to a file::

    planet data filter --range cloud_cover lt .1 --geom aoi.json > my-search.json

Create a saved search from a filter in a file with some additional options (this will output the search id for later use)::

    planet data create-search --item-type PSScene3Band --string-in satellite_id 0c12 --name my-search --filter-json my-search.json

Execute a saved search::

    planet data saved-search 4782d4118fee4275860665129a1e23c1

Get statistics using a filter from a file::

    planet data stats --item-type Sentinel2L1C --filter-json my-search.json

Activate and download the latest 3 PSScene3Band items to `images-download-directory`.

Note: this might take some time and directory must exist::

    planet data download --item-type PSScene3Band --limit 3 --dest images-download-directory

Mosaic Examples
---------------

List information for all mosaics you have access to::

    planet mosaics list

Note that you may want to parse the JSON that's output into a more human
readable format.  The cli does not directly provide options for this, but is
meant to be easily interoperable with other tools, e.g. `jq
<https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_.  For example, we could output just the name
and date range of each mosaic with::

    planet mosaics list | jq -r '.mosaics[] | [.name, .first_acquired, .last_acquired] | @tsv' 

Get basic information for a specific mosaic::

    planet mosaics info global_monthly_2018_09_mosaic

List the first 10 quads for a mosaic (Omitting the ``--limit`` option will
list all quads. Keep in mind that there may be millions for a global mosaic.)::

    planet mosaics search global_monthly_2018_09_mosaic --limit=10

Find all quads inside a particular area of interest::
    
    planet mosaics search global_monthly_2018_09_mosaic --bbox=-95.5,29.6,-95.3,29.8

Note that the format of ``--bbox`` is "xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax", so longitude comes
before latitude.

Get basic information (footprint, etc) for a particular mosaic quad::

    planet mosaics quad-info global_monthly_2018_09_mosaic 480-1200

Determine which scenes contributed to a particular mosaic quad::

    planet mosaics contribution global_monthly_2018_09_mosaic 480-1200

Download all quads for a mosaic (this is impractical for large mosaics, which
are hundreds of Terabytes in size)::

    planet mosaics download <mosaic_name>

Download all quads inside of a rectangular box for a mosaic::

    planet mosaics download global_monthly_2018_09_mosaic --bbox=-95.5,29.6,-95.3,29.8

Get information about a mosaic series::

    planet mosaics series describe <series_id>

Get list of mosaics in a mosaic series::

    planet mosaics series list-mosaics <series_id>

Analytics Examples
------------------
These examples assume that the reader is already familiar with the `Analytics User Guide`_.

.. _`Analytics User Guide`: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ZgGIFKb9IxxVMjTb603lRd6pwEygcri5rKxcsEjk8E/

List information for all feeds, subscriptions, or collections you have access to::

    planet analytics feeds list
    planet analytics subscriptions list
    planet analytics collections list

Note that you may want to parse the JSON that's output into a more human
readable format.  The cli does not directly provide options for this, but is
meant to be easily interoperable with other tools, e.g. `jq
<https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_.  For example, for feeds we may be interested in the ID,
description, and the target and source mosaics (if applicable)::

    planet analytics feeds list | jq -r '.data[] | [.id, .description, .created, .source.config.series_id, .target.config.series_id]'

For a subscription, the ID, description, source feed ID, and the created date are useful::

    planet analytics subscriptions list | jq -r '.data[] | [.id, .feedID, .created]'

Get the first 10 subscriptions for a feed::

    planet analytics subscriptions list --feed-id <feed-id> --limit 10

Get information about a particular feed, subscription, or collection::

    planet analytics feeds describe <feed_id>
    planet analytics subscriptions describe <subscription_id>
    planet analytics collections describe <collection_id or subscription_id>

List all mosaics associated with a feed, subscription, or collection (if the feed is mosaics-based only)::

    planet analytics feeds list-mosaics <feed_id>
    planet analytics subscriptions list-mosaics <subscription_id>
    planet analytics collections list-mosaics <collection_id or subscription_id>

Get all features (GeoJSON results) for a collection::

    planet analytics collections features list <collection_id or subscription_id>

Get the first 500 features (GeoJSON results) for a collection within a certain time range::

    planet analytics collections features list <collection_id or subscription_id> --time-range 2019-01-01T00:00:00.00Z/2019-02-01T00:00:00.00Z --limit 500

Get all features (GeoJSON results) for a collection within a certain area::

    planet analytics collections features list <collection_id or subscription_id> --bbox 122.3,47.6,122.4,47.7

It is also possible to get resources associated with a particular GeoJSON feature in a collection.
The resource that may be requested depends on the specific feed; not all resources will be available
for all feeds or any collections associated with those feeds.

* `source-quad`: Download the mosaic quad used to derive a feature, only available for collections associated with feeds that operate on mosaics
* `target-quad`: Download the mosaic quad that contains the raster output of a feed, only available for collections associated with feeds that output raster data
* `source-image-info`: Get the metadata for the source Planet product (ex. PSScene3Band) used to derive a feature, only available for non-mosaic feeds

Requesting a resource for a feature in a collection::

    planet analytics collections features get source-quad <collection_id or subscription_id> <feature_id>
    planet analytics collections features get target-quad <collection_id or subscription_id> <feature_id>
    planet analytics collections features get source-image-info <collection_id or subscription_id> <feature_id>

Integration With Other Tools
----------------------------

The output of search results is valid GeoJSON so these can be piped into a file or tool.

Create a `gist` using the `gist <http://defunkt.io/gist/>`_ command::

    planet data search --item-type psscene --limit 100 | gist -f latest-scenes.geojson

Searching Using a Shapefile
...........................

Searching an area of interest described by a Shapefile, can be accomplished by chaining commands with `Fiona <https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona>`_.::

    $ fio dump santiago-de-chile.shp | planet data search --item-type psscene --geom @-

Note: the `@-` value for `--geom` specifies reading from stdin

Extracting Metadata Fields
..........................

Using jq_, useful information can be parsed from data returned by the Planet API.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ planet data search --item-type psscene --limit 100 | jq -r ".features[].id"
    20150707_160055_090b
    20150707_160054_090b
    20150707_160053_090b
    20150707_160051_090b
    20150707_160050_090b
    20150707_160048_090b
    20150707_160047_090b
    20150707_160046_090b
    ...

Search Overlapping Imagery
..........................

Querying for Planet scenes that overlap another data source is easily accomplished by using `Rasterio <https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio>`_.
Given that this Landsat scene was taken on April 14, 2015, it might be useful to search for Planet scenes that were taken in a similar timeframe.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rio bounds LC82210682015104LGN00_B1.TIF | planet data search --item-type psscene --geom - --date acquired gt 2015-04-12 --date acquired lt 2015-04-14
